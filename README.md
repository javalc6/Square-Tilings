*SquareTiling* includes tiles like Greek key, Islamic stars, octagons, checkers, tartan and interlaced motifs, which can be tiled across the application panel in real time. 

Users can adjust tile size, choose from four customizable colors, preview individual tiles and export the resulting tiling as a PNG image.
